   C programming language use printf statement, new lines escape sequence, tabs. Connect to matrix server using SSH and 
   transfer files from local computer to matrix server using SFTP. Compile and execute the C program and make a submission

-> SSH (Secure Shell Protocal) is a network protocal which gives a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.
   In the workshop I used SSH to connect to the matrix server securely using ssh username@matrix.senecacollege.ca and perform 
   my workshops submission on the matrix server. 

3. Briefly describe what SFTP is and how you used it in this workshop.
-> SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocal) is a file transfer protocal that uses shell encryption and provides high level of
   security to send and recieve files from one computer to another. I used SFTP to transfer my workshop source code from my 
   computer over to matrix server using FileZilla application which is a secure way to transefer files.
