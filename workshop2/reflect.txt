->Answer no 1. 
We have to ne very precise and careful while using data type to represent
the values in c programming. This occured because of the use float type of variable.
The compiler for C program doesnot put the exact value 
for the float data type but puts the value near. 

->Answer no 2.
In sample one: by dividing money with 100.0 we are casting the data type of integer to a double data type 
In sample two: we are using explicit type casting to change int data type to the double data type
In sample three: we are using explicitly coercion to make the compiler know we are changing
from int to double data type

->Answer no 3. 
a.The value of variable result is 70 because we have this expression result = money/100
and the variable is set to int data type

b.The values displayed for sample 1,2,3 and 4 are: 
1. $0.00
2. $72
3. $0.00
4. $72

c. It can be concluded that since there is no any type of casting applied. The value 
shown by the printf is correct since the data type is not converted.
